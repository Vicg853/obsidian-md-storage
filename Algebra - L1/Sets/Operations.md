#### Development
Just like many other mathematical operations, one of the most simple development properties, can also be applied to sets:
- $E \cup (F \cap G) = (E \cup F) \cap (F \cup G)$
- $E \cap (F \cup G) = (E \cap F) \cup (F \cap G)$

#### Difference
Difference operations with sets, behave the following

> [!abstract] DIFFERENCE
> A simple difference equation with sets is noted ``\ `` and behaves the following $E \setminus F = \{x | x \in E \land x \notin F \}$.
> A.k.a.: we remove the possibility of $x$ from being in $F$. 

> [!abstract] SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE
> Noted $Δ$ represents parts from both sets in the equation that dong belong to both sets both: $E Δ F = (E \cup F) \setminus (E \cap F)$.
> A.k.a.: we could say it is the opposite of $E \cap F$, that it removes were both are "symmetric" or "equal"

#### Summup
We can therefore sum everything up and conclude that:
