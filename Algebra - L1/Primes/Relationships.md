### GCD
The a special relationship with prime numbers: 
1) For two prime numbers, its value is of ``1`` and therefore, they are either equal, or are simply  [[Greatest common divisor#Related primes| related primes]].
2) For a prime number and a composed number its value is also of ``1``

### Integer decomposition
Every integer can be decomposed into a product of integers.

We can interpose this with divisibility and prime domains: if a prime divides the product of a group of integers, by rule, it divides at least one of the group's elements.

Mathematically we state this as $p\ |\ (a_1 \cdot\ ... a_i) \iff p\ |\ a_i$.
We usually note this as $\mathscr{P}(k)$, where ``k`` is the last ``i``th value.

##### Composition of primes
This allows us to also state that, every integer $n$, can be be decomposed into a product of a single or multiple primes, to a certain power.

$$n = p_1^{\alpha_1}\cdot p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdot\ ...\ p_r^{\alpha_r}$$
