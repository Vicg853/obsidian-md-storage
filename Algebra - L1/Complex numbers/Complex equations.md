As [[Algebra - L1/Complex numbers/Intro|seen ]] previously, complex equations, are composed of an imaginary unit and give back a complex result $z$.

Here are some of this function's properties and behaviours:
#### $z$ equality 
Two $z$ numbers, can only be considered equal, when both their imaginary and real parts are the same:

$$a+ib = a'+ib' \iff (a=a' \mathsf{et} b=b')$$

#### Equation addition and multiplication
There are two key properties which are possible with complex equations:
- The addition of two c.e.s $(a + ib) + (a' + ib') = (a+a')+i(b+b')$
- The multiplication of two c.e.s $(a + ib) \cdot (a' - ib') = (aa' - bb')+ i(ab' + ba')$

#### Null imaginary part
As for when $b = b' = 0$ we end up with a null imaginary part, which means that:
- complex equations addition will end up becoming $z = a+a'$
- complex equations multiplication will end up becoming $z = aa'$
- a complex number, will be written $z = a$

#### Pure imaginary
We have a pure imaginary when $a = 0$.

#### $a^2 + b^2$ identity
The complex number, also alters $a^2 + b^2$'s fate, as we have $i^2 = -1$:
$$(a+ib)\ (a-ib)=a^2 + b^2$$
