Complex arithmetic, allows us to define and solve equations/cases, where a solution usually doesn't exist. 

For example, for the a famous negative $\Delta$ identity on double polynomial equations.

Complex equations, feature a very special element: the imaginary unit $i$, which is defined by the following key properties:
- $i = 1$
- $i^2 = -1$
- $i^3 = i^2 \cdot i = -1 \cdot i = -i$
- $i^4 = i^2 \cdot i^2 = -1 \cdot -1 = 1$
This results cycle and repeat themselves over and over again. 

#### Complex number
When a number is in the complex domain noted $\Bbb C$, it is usually named $z$ and is composed of a complex equation, that is: it is defined by a [[#Complex equation|complex equation]] and contains an imaginary unit $i$. 

For example: $z = 4+i5$.

#### Complex equation
On complex equations... A complex equation is composed of two main elements:
- $a$ defined as the real part of $z$ and noted $\mathtt{Re}(z)$ 
- $b$ defined as $z$'s imaginary part and noted $\mathtt{lm}(z)$ 

This leads us to the complex equation's format: $z = a + ib$
