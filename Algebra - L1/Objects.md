A mathematical object can be compared to coordinates, but actually can represent a multitude of things

#### Couples
A couple, is the set of two mathematical objects, in a certain defined order (which means, you can't write them in any order). Couples are noted using parenthesis: $(x, y)$. 

As said, they have a specific order, which means: $(x, y) = (y, x) \implies x = y$. This is different from a [[Sets|set]] where the order does not matter, although sets are objects themselves. Sets are called "pairs".

Couples, are indeed, a new object themselves.

#### Cartesian product
The product of two sets is called a cartesian product. It is the product of an $x$ an element of a set and $y$ another element of a set. It is noted $A\ \mathsf x\ B$ and is $= \{(x, y) | x \in A \land y \in B \}$

In this case, our couple results in a set.

We may use the following table visualization for a cartesian product:

We can therefore, in this case for example, compare it to coordinates, where ou $A$ will represent values in an ``x`` axis and $B$ in an ``y`` axis. This graph represents everything explained here:

You see, the product results graphically in: 
- elements of the $A$ object/set, represent values in a ``x`` axis: 0 to 1 and constant 2; 
- while elements from the $B$ object/set, represent values in the ``y`` axis: -3 to 2 and 5 to positive infinity

Cartesian products, are also followed by these properties: 
- $(A \cap C)\ \mathsf x\ (B \cap D) = (A\ \mathsf x\ B) \cap (C\ \mathsf x\ D)$
- ("or"s can be distributed) $(A \cup B)\ \mathsf x\ (C \cup D) = (A\ \mathsf x\ C) \cup (A\ \mathsf x\ D) \cup (B\ \mathsf x\ C) \cup (B\ \mathsf x\ D)$
