Bachet-Bezout states that $au + bv = a \land b$.

Moere specifically $a$ and $b$'s GCD, will be equal to $a \cdot u$ plus $b \cdot v$, where $u, v, a, b \in \Bbb N$, for a certain $u$ and $v$. 

### Properties
Consider $E$ the solution set of a Bachet-Bazout's identity. The solutions in $E$ will always be positive and $E$ itself will never be an empty set:
- If $a$ and $b$ are 0, $E = \{\ 0\ \}$
- Considering we have $b$ and $v$ equals to 0:
	- If $a > 0$, we have $u = 1$
	- If $a < 0$, we have $u = -1$, otherwise we would have a negative GCD, which is technically impossible in a real definition
