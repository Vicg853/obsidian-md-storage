On arithmetic's integer definition interval world, we say a number is divisible by another, if for that number, there is a $k$ where: $\forall a = b.k$.

We note it $a \vert b$, which means $b$ is divisible by $a$.

With that, we may state some properties: 
- $1 \vert a$
- If $a \vert 1$, then $a = \pm1$
- Reflexivity: $a \vert a$
- $a \vert 0$
- If $0|a$ then $a = 0$
