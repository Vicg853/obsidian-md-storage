### Definition
On arithmetic, saying that a number $a$ which is divides a number $b$, states that: $a \cdot k = b$, where we must have $a, b, k \in \Bbb N$ ($a$, $b$, and $k$ are integers).

We note it $a \vert b$, which means $a$ divides $b$.

##### Dividers intervals
We note a number's divisors set with $\mathcal D(b)$. It is defined in the following way: $\mathcal D(b) := \{a_3, a_2, a_1, a\}$

### Properties
##### Some base properties:
- $1 \vert a$
- If $a \vert 1$, then $a = \pm1$
- Reflexivity: $a \vert a$
- $a \vert 0$
- If $0|a$ then $a = 0$
