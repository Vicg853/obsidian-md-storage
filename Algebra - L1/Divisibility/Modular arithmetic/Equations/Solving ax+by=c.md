The entire modular arithmetic subject, can be joined into solving a single mathematical problem: $ax+by=c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants:

We can interpolate this equation into a modular equation, where $a = a$, $b = n$ and $c = b$: $$a \equiv c\ [b]$$

This is possible when we have a $(x, k)$ set, which are solutions of $ax+by=c$.
