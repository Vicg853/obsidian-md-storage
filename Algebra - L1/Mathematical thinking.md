To go on with this, be sure to have a good understanding of [[Intro|boolean logic basics]] and [[Vocab|basic vocabulary]]. 

#### Syllogism
With Syllogism (or as also called direct thinking), we simply follow a direct flow of thinking, going through each of the statement's steps and proving each one at its time.

#### Case separation (or case disjunction)
As the name explains, we split the statement into steps and solve them each in its isolated space and then we join everything together for a final conclusion.

It is useful with absolute values for example, when the equation must usually be solved with two separate point of views: when $x \lt 0$ and $x \ge 0$. 

#### Contrapositive
Proving by contraposition is done by inverting and showing a statement is false. Using Boolean logic this translates to converting $P \implies Q$ into $\lnot Q \implies \lnot P$ and demonstrating this translated statement is valid.

#### By absurd
When reasoning by absurd we follow an absurd logic which concludes into a called contradictory statement.

#### By counterexample


#### By recursivity
