#### Axiom
An axiom is a statement which everyone agrees on. We could say it is a mathematical argument, if we compare it to written argumentative texts: a small proven statement, that contributes to a whole argumentative theory.

#### Theory
A theory is an assertion, which we prove by basing ourselves from multiple small axioms or other already proven theories. We could compare it to argumentative texts in a whole, with an introduction, development and conclusion.
