Here are some recap of trigonometry basics. Note that, we are studying trigonometry, in a orthonormal and Euclidian plan. 

We have an $R^2$ plan and defined by $(O, \vec i, \vec j)$, where each point has for coordinates $(x, y)$.

#### Basic properties
1) The trigonometric has an origin point, that is $(1, 0)$
2) Trigonometric coordinates usually use radian values. 
	> [!NOTE]
	> Just for note, the equivalent in degrees of $a$ (in radians), is:
	> $$\alpha = a\cdot {\pi\over 180}$$
3) Every point $M$, in a trigonometric circle, has an $\alpha$ distance from the origin coordinates
4) We can cycle many times around the circle, which will always end up in the same origin coordinates
5) The $\pi$ entity, has the value of half a cycle (half a circle perimeter) and therefore $2\pi$ represents a whole cycle.
	> [!INFO] 
	> When cycling through the circle multiple times, if the distance $m$:
	> $$\left\{\begin{array}{l}m\equiv 0 [2] \implies m(1,0)\\  m\equiv 1 [2] \implies m(-1,0)\end{array} \right.$$
	
	> [!INFO]
	> As we know that $2\pi$ is a full cycle, when considering two points $a, a'$ we can fully assume that that they are actually the same point if: $a - a' = k2\pi, k\in\Bbb Z$.
	> In this case $a'$ is usually called called $a$'s _argument_.
	

#### Euclidian distance
The Euclidian distance between two points, noted $d$, is of: $d(A_1, A_2) = \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$

#### Trigonometric functions
There are three main trigonometric functions. Each has its own graphical meaning, in a trigonometric circle:
- $cos$: is $M$'s $x$ value
- $sin$: is $M$'s $y$ value
- $tan$: is $M$'s value in the $T$ axis, which is tangent to the circle in the coordinate $(0, 1)$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> $cos(\alpha)^2+sin(\alpha)^2=1$
