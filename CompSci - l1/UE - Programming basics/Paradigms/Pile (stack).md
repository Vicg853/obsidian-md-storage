In computer science, there is an idea of stacking data, just like a stack of plates. 

Just like the analogy of stacked plates, we can't remove the first plate from the bottom to the top, we must always remove the top one (a.k.a last stacked plate), as removing a bottom one, could cause the entire pile to fall.
We call this tecnique also LIFO: last in, first out.
