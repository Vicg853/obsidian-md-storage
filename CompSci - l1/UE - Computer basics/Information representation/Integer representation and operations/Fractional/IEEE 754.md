The IEEE 754 standard, is a normalization of the floating point number representation, which is used until nowadays, for fractional number representation on computers.

The IEEE defined two representations for floating point numbers: a 32-bit called float and the 64-bit called double, as it is more precise than its 32-bit brother, as its mantissa is larger.
