# Definitions
## Canonical function
A function is defined as a normal canonical function if all of its inner fields are composed by its variables.

## Disjontivite
Disjontive boolean functions are composed of multiple AND operations groups, separated by OR operators. By example: ``(a • b • c) + (b • c) + (c • a)``

## Conjonctivite
Conjunctive boolean functions are characterized by groups of OR operations , separated by AND operators. By example: ``(a + b + c) • (b + c) • (c + a)``
