# Definitions
## Canonical function
A function is defined as a normal canonical function if all of its inner fields (operation groups) are composed by all its variables.

A non canonical function: ``a • (b + !b) • (c + !c)``
And here is its canonical form: ``(a • b • c) + (a • b • !c) + (a • !b • c) + (a • !b • !c)``

## Disjontivite
Disjontive boolean functions are composed of multiple AND operations groups, separated by OR operators. By example: ``(a • b • c) + (b • c) + (c • a)``

## Conjonctivite
Conjunctive boolean functions are characterized by groups of OR operations , separated by AND operators. By example: ``(a + b + c) • (b + c) • (c + a)``
