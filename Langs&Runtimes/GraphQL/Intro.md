GraphQl, is currently an open-source query language (since 2015), firstly created by Facebook engineers (holly shit, they are fucking good at this: react, graphql, redux, ...) on 2013. 
The idea behind GraphQl was to fix two main issues that normal APIs present: low scalability and over-fetching...

How so?
