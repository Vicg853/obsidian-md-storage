## Intro
Rust has some built-in utils to help you with your workflow.

### rustup
The Rust version manager. This tool helps you manage and switch between Rust versions. 
Some of basic commands are:
- ```rustup update [version-name (optional)]```: updates all versions or a specific version
- ```rustup uninstall [version-name]```: uninstall a specific version
- ```rusttup install [versio-name]```: install an specific version
- ```rustup check```: Checks if all installed version are up-to-date
- ```rustup doc``` : get the local downloaded documentation version. This way you may read the documentation even offline (how cool!!)

### rustc
This is basically the main Rust cli tool (which's version can be changed by the ```rustup``` tool).
