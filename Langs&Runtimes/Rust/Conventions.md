### File/dir conventions
- ``folder/mod.rs`` corresponds to the "root" file for this folder (e.g.: just like index on javascript)
- When creating libraries the main file should be lib.rs 
- When creating binaries the main file should be main.rs


### Naming
Rust uses the snake case convention: 
- All lower case letters
- Spaces denoted by a ``_``
