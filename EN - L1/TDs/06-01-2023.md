Since the start, mankind has always looked for a leader, which could establish order, provide protection and stability. Across ages, we've seen a variety of regimes and leader types, from kings and their kingdoms, to dictators with totalitarianism, until landing on presidential and minister based governments. Since then, a key event emerged: elections, along with its own obstacles to be overcame; Such as: "How to ensure fair votes?", "How to handle vote counting/storage?", "How to prevent manipulation/cheating?" and so on. With these problems, existing developed techniques and top of the notch technology, two possible solutions emerged: paper and electronic voting, which will be the subject of this debate.
