## Exercice on the text: Mobile phones "may trigger Alzheimer\'s"
#### Summary
The text presents as research funded and lead by the British government, regarding mobile phone radiation and its effects on human brain cells. The research carried out on rats, shows that those waves could provoke brain damage and even Alzheimer. Still the lead researcher Professor Salford, explains that even with the nature of the tests, nothing has been really proven yet and we shouldn't panic, even though that more research should be led on this subject. 
Anyhow, an independent expert group on the subject, states that yes, this should't be reason for panic, but people should prevent making phone calls, as much as possible and keep them as short as possible. As for people, they say, specially teenagers.
