An affine function follows a pattern of ``f(x) = ax + b``, where ``a`` and ``b`` are to fixed numbers.

We say that an affine function is *constant* if ``a`` is equal to 0, as this will make it equal to ``b``, which doesn't change.
As for when ``b`` is equal to 0, we call it a *linear* function, where it is equal to ``ax``. A linear function passes through [0; 0] coordinates in a normal plan as ``x = 0 => ax = 0``
