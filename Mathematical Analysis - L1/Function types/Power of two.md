The power of two function, represented by: $\sqrt{a} = b^2$, where we have ``a`` a strictly positive number and ``b``, which opposed to ``a``, is defined in ℝ.

> Not that $y = \sqrt{x}$ will always be composed of two solutions: the negative and the positive parties of an integer; While its counterpart  $y = x^2$ only has an only solution and will at least have two solutions with $x \inℝ$.

## Graph
A small graphical property is that, the the $y = x^2$ and $y = \sqrt{x}$ equations are symmetric on a  $y = x$ reference.
