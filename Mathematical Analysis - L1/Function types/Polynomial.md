A polynomial function follows the pattern: $a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_nx^n$.

Their properties are:
- The combination (a.k.a. the addition) of two polynomial functions is a polynomial function;
- The product of two polynomial functions is a polynomial function (if not one of them is a null function);
- The combination of two polynomial function is the product of their degrees all-together.



## Examples

- *Affine* The affine function actually is a polynomial function, of first degree
- *$x \mapsto (x - 1)(x - 3) = x^2 + 2x + - 3$* is a polynomial function of second degree.
- *$x \mapsto 3 - 2x + 0,5x^2 - x^4 + 4x^5$* is a polynomial function of fifth degree
