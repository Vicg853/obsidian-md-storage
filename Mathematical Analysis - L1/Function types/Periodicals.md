Periodical functions, can be defined that $\forall x, f(x + T) = f(x)$, where T is a fixed strictly positive integer, that represents f's variation period. We can also say that $\forall x \in \Bbb R, \forall n \in \Bbb Z, f(x + nT) = f(x)$ 

The sinus function is an example of a periodical function. 

$T_m$ is called the minimal period, if any other period is superior or equal to it. We can therefore say that all other periods are $T_m, 2T_m, 3T_m, \dots$

## Graph
Graphically we may affirm that a periodic function, in a normal plan, is invariant by the horizontal translation of a vector $\overrightarrow u = T\overrightarrow{OI}$ and that if a point M, where $M \in C$ of ``(x, y)`` coordinates, where C is f's curve, we can say that $M(x + T, y) \in C$.
