As stated [[Mathematical Analysis - L1/Function/Types/N Root | here]], the $\sqrt[n]{x}$ function has a some special behaviour based on the truthiness of the following statement $2 \mid n$.

Therefore, its derivative's behaviour also changes.

When $2 \mid n$ we have $(\sqrt[n]{x})' \in ] 0; +\infty[$. 
As for when $2 \nmid n$ we have $(\sqrt[n]{x})' \in \Bbb R^*$.
