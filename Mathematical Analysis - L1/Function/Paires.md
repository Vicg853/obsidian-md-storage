We can define a function as pair, if both these statements are fulfilled with $f: D \to ‚Ñù$:
- $\forall x \in D, -x \in D$
- $\forall x \in D, f(-x) = f(x)$

Some interesting properties of pair functions, is that: 
- The product or addition of two pair functions results into a pair function
- The product or addition of two impair functions results into an impair function
- The product or addition between an impair and a pair function results into an impair function

## Gaph
Graphically, we can see that pair functions are symmetric in the y axis, while impair functions aren't
