Bijective functions are a mix of injective and superjective functions, and at the same time every element of a set points to another element of the other set and vise-versa (each element has it correspondant symmetry point) (_note this it shouldn't be confused with one-to-one correspondance, like a fully injective function_)
That is a bijection is defined on $f: X \to Y$ and must comply with the followings statements (where $X$ and $Y$ are two sets):  
- $(\forall y \in Y, \exists x \in X), \implies f(x) = y$
- $(\forall x \in X, \exists!y \in Y) \implies f(x) = y$.
