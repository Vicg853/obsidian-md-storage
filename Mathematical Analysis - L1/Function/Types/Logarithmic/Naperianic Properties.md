The naperian logarithm function has some pretty special properties, primarily along other mathematical symbols and operators.

$ln(e) = 1$

#### Powers 
$ln(a^n) = n \cdot \mathsf{ln}(a)$
$a^2 = e^{n\ \mathsf{ln}(a)}$

We also have some application with the derivative of a power function:
$f: x \mapsto a^x,\ f'(x) = \mathsf{ln}(a)e^{x \ \mathsf{ln}(a)} = \mathsf{ln}(a)a^x$
