There are a couple of characteristics that are present and common to most programming languages:
- they all have a vocabulary, defined as a couple of keywords and symbols with a special meaning for the reader
- alphanumeric characters, used in such pattern defined by it
- syntactic defining how all elements should be organized and ordered
- semantic
- comments which are considered as characters that shouldn't be directly interpreted and processed by the language

#### Interpretation steps
Similarly they all usually share the same three following interpretation steps:
1) Lexical analysis, tasked with the content's tokenization
2) Syntactic analysis where a token three is created
3) Analysis of previous structures consistency with the languages grammar and rules
