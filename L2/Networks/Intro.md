The internet has evolved a lot in the past decades: we've seen fixed devices, become mobile ones, which was followed by an explosion of them with IoT and now, we at an era where everything and everyone is connected.

Behind it all, some complex networks are hidden but connecting everything together.

#### Client-Servers 
There is a core concept used in computer science, the called server and client entities: a computer working to deliver data and services (a server) and another consuming/requesting such provided content (a client).

Although client-server exchanges are the most common, it isn't enforcement for it to be done in such way. We have for example, the peer-to-peer concept (usually also known as _P2P_), where two computers communicate with each-other directly, therefore acting both as server and client as they will.

#### Network components
Networks can be split in three main core component groups: 
###### Peripherals:
Any device, connected to a network, being it a consumer or actor amongst it, is considered as it (computers, switches, routers, VoIP terminals, etc...). They are themselves also split in half:
- Final peripherals, which are usually servers, clients and etc (servers aren't considered as infrastructure, as they are built for a specific purposes usually differing from networks)
- Infrastructure peripherals, considered any device responsible of maintaining a group of devices connected, making of itself a network (switches, routers)
###### Supports:
Any means of data transportation, they are currently mostly composed of wireless communication, copper cables (using energy currents for signal transmission) and optical cables
###### Services

All these services and connection sum-up into a single
