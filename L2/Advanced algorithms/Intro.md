Algorithms are essential in programming and the world in overall. They are the building blocks of any simple or complex task being performed by a computer or person.

This class introduces us to some basic "complex algorithms" as well as some algorithmic concepts. Most algorithms will be described in [[Pseudo-code| pseudo-code]] to remove language biases (for both human and computer languages).

Some of the concepts introduced are: 
- [[Trees]].

As for algorithms we have:
- [[Backtracking]];
- [[Trees#Algorithms| Tree related algorithms]]

Furthermore, each of an algorithm's instruction, takes time and space for/during its execution, and this can result in major drawbacks or advantages, in large scale. To study and solve problems related to those, the [[L2/Advanced algorithms/Algorithmic complexity/Intro|complexity theories]] were introduced.
