Algorithms are essential in programming and the world in overall. They are the building blocks of any simple or complex task being performed by a computer or person.

This class introduces us to some basic "complex algorithms" as well as some algorithmic concepts. Most algorithms will be described in [[Pseudo-code| pseudo-code]] to remove language biases (for both human and computer languages).

Some of the concepts introduced are: 
- [[Trees]].

As for algorithms we have:
- [[Backtracking]];
- [[Trees#Algorithms| Tree related algorithms]]
