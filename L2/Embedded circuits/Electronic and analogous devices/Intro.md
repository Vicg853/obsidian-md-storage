Nowadays, embedded circuits are "smarter" (or actually, more flexible) than the earlier computers and FPGAs: they are usually able to perform multiple tasks, by performing many logical and arithmetic operations. 

Therefore, we are able to either go very high on this subject, with complex computer towers and servers, running OSs and etc; or stay low (which we are going to do) and hover around embedded circuitry and low-power SoCs/chips/etc. 

#### Electronics
When working with embedded circuits, there is a thigh interaction between the real and virtual worlds. So for, it is important to recap basics on electronics and its basics:

###### Ohms law and resistors
Resistance is the concept that every electronic device holds the current that it is provided with. 

###### Capacitors

_Charging capacity_: $V_C(t) = E\ (1 - \exp{- t \over R_C}\ )$
_Capacity usage_: $V_C(t) = E\ \exp{- t \over R_C}$

###### Diodes
Diodes, anode (input), cathode (output), only way

###### Transistors

###### Electronic amps

#### Arduinos (ATMega 328P more precisely)
