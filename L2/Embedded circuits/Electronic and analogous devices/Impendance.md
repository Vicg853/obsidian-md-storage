In a resistor daisy chain, the global resistance corresponds to the sum of all ``R``s: $R_eq = \sum^n_{i=0} R_i$. 
As for in a concurrent circuit, it switches into: $R_eq = \sum^n_{i=0} {1\over R_i}$
(on both, n is the resistor count and i is each respective resistor in the system)

#### Millman's theorem

The sum of all tensions in a single point ``N`` connected by a resistor is null.

#### x's law
$V_N = {{{V_0 \over R_0} + {V_i \over R_i}} \over {{1 \over R_0} + {1 \over R_i}}}\ \forall i \in n$
