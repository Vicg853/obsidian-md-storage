#### SoCs

#### Analogous and digital systems
An analogous signal is considered a continuous signal, meanwhile a digital one doe

#### FPGA and SoPC
Both FPGA and SoPC are chips, on which we code and define instructions. The big difference between them, is that one of them (FPGAs) can't be reprogrammed differently from SoPC.

We could say that FPGAs are kinda like engraved sculptures, that can't be easily modified and must be re-engraved, as for SoPC, they are designed in a way that code can be written for it to be rewritten multiple times.
