Real-life problems can be solved in many different ways, with the use of various algorithms. Among them, we have what the so called "linear programming" field. This field surrounds a core programming model, that makes use of linear algebraic properties and functions, to solve an availability to optimal quantity dilema.

How so? Consider the case we need to produce x quantity of a given product and y of another one. Then add a new layer to it: we have limited u and v quantities of base elements, used by both products. 
Which is optimal climax configuration, allowing us to reach a peak production in each them?

## Three modeling pilars
1) Which quantities are we working on?
2) What are we looking foward to optimize?
3) Which are the constraints?

When solving linear problems our goal is to always either maximize, or to minimize the result.
