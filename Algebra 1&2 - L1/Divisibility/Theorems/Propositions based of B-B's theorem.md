[[Bachet-Bezout's theorem]] inspires many other proofs:

### Solving $ax+by=c$
Based on both Bachet-Bazout's theorem and the [[Greatest common divisor|GCD]], we can assume the following property:

If $a\land b \not{|} c$, there is no solution of $x$ and $y$ for $c$. 
As Bezout states: $au+bv= a\land b$, so should be $c = k(a\land b)$.
