In modular arithmetic, the inverse corresponds to an integer, usually noted $ã$, that when multiplying $a$ does not imply any changes to a modular equation where $b = 1$ (apart from $a$ itself).
$$aã \equiv 1\ [n] \iff aã \equiv 1\ [nk]$$

This is more precisely translated into: if $ã$ is an inverse of $a$ $\iff \exists k \in \Bbb Z\ \ aã + kn = 1$.
Which means that for an inverse $ã$ of $a$, which when multiplying $n$ by a certain $k$, results in one.

##### Bachet-Bezout
The previous equations is actually quite familiar: it connects with [[Bachet-Bezout's theorem|Bachet-Bezout's theorem]], where $au+bv=a\land b$. 

Consequently we can state that $aã+nk=a\land n$ and therefore, that if $a$ has an inverse in $n$ if $a \land n=1$, A.K.A.: _a and n_ are _coprimes_.
