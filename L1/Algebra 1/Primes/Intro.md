A prime number, is defined as an integer, that has only two integer divisors, which are one and himself.

The mathematical expression that says it is: $$p_\mathsf{\ (a\ prime)} \iff \left\{\begin{array}{l}
p \ge 2\\
\forall d \in \Bbb{N}, [\ d|p \iff (d = 1 \mathsf{\ or\ } d = p)\ ] 
\end{array}\right.$$

##### Composed
Integers that aren't primes, are called: composed integers.


> [!WARNING] Exception
>You must note that there are two exceptions to this rule: ``0`` and ``1``.

> - ``0``, can be divided by one, but can't be divided by himself, as 
> - ``1`` only has himself as a divisor
> More precisely: they aren't considered _neither composed nor prime_ integers.
