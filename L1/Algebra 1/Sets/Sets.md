Mathematical sets can be summarized with three main words: set, element and belonging (ensemble, élément and appartenance): consider $x$ an integer and $E$ a set, we note $x \in E$, which states the _element_ $x$ _belongs_ to the $E$ _set_. 

> [!INFO]
> A set can also be considered an element

> [!WARNING]
> Every set is an element, but not every element is a set. Take the previous statement as an example: we have $E$ that is both a set and an element at the same time, and $x$ which is simply an element.

There are two notations for sets:
- simple interval or listing declarations: ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5} \lor [0; 5]$
- or by equation assertion: lets consider a $P(x)$ and $E = \{\ x\ | \ P(x)\ \}$. This states that $E$ is defined by every $x$ for which $P(x)$ is true.

#### Empty sets
We state that a set is empty when it has no elements whatsoever. We note an empty set E: $E = \emptyset$

Every set contains the empty set, consider $F = {1, 2}$ for example: $\emptyset \subset F$.
Also every subset of an empty set is equal to an empty set: $(E \subset \emptyset) \implies (E = \emptyset)$
