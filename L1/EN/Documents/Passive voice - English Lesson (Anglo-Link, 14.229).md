The passive voice is used when either the subject is too obvious or when it is unknown.

When a preposition is present in the sentence's normal voice, it should be placed at the end of the passive sentence. 

We don't use the passive voice when the sentence's tense is either in the present, past or future perfect continuous.

When using the infinitive in sentences its passive voice should be formed by the verb _"to be" + the respective's verb past participle_ (do -> being done).
As for when the expression contains the gerund, we use the form _"being" + the respective verb's past participle_
