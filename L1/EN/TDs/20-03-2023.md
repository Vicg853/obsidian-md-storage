#### St-Patrick's day (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5KNQ1xciMQ)
StPatrick isn't actually Irish -> but British, then part of the Roman empire
kidnapped by Irish raiders at 16 and kept in captivity for 6 years

Converted then to Christianity and came back to Ireland to work as a Missionary

Forgotten at death, until centuries later being honorred as Ireland's patron saint.

Myths:
- He drove of the island's snakes -> no snakes ever existed there as water is too cold for them to migrate there
- The shamrock he used to explain the holy trinity, which does not actually exists -> tho two pretty similar plants exists

Even with the plant being a myth, people started wearing them to symbol their faith and also started wearing green clothing

Paredes: actually started in america, after the great potato famine sent many Irish people migrated to U.S.. The first parade dates of British and Irish soldiers walking down to a pub in Manhattan and became today the largest StPatrick's Day Parade
