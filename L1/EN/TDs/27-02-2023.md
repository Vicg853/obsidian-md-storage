The largest particle research laboratory in the world and so called CERN (C European). It is located 100m beneath the Swiss-French border and is considered the largest machine in the world, being a 27km loop, featuring 9600 magnets and 10 accelerators that push the particles  

4 experiements 

along the tunnel, many machines for cooling and beam(s) alignement

Beams colide and conditions similar to the bigbang are created inside the CMS (compact m solenoid). It allows us to collect information from even smaller particles produced during the colision.

Scientists expect to create even bigger reactions in the future and therefore discover more about other secrets of the univers such as dark matter.
