#### Conclusion
Yes devices help with information acknowledgement: smartphones are a good example of that, talk to everyone and entertainment ourselves. And it may increasing life expectancy.

But still many consequences are still unknown and we already have good proofs of possible Alzheimer and other physical/neurological damages and many phsycological issues, almost getting to pandemic scale. 
Therefore, yes, maybe we shouldn't abandon technology, but accept that there are dangers and that studies prove drawbacks each day. And by that, primarily, pay attention to children, as they are the futures habitants and maintainers of our planet.

To sum everything up, we may not abandon technology, but we also don't wan't to live a distopical reality, as remember: we can't eat bytes.
