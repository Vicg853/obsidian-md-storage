### Who invented the computer? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1pvc9Zh7Tg)

1844 Charles Babbage. The analytical machine -> could calculate and save mathematical operations using a CPU and memory, that could be programmer 
Conceived 150 years (1991) later for fun, it worked as predicted

Alan Turing, foundation idea of mathematical statement being answered by true or false. "Blueprint" for automatic computation. General purpose computer

Konrad Zuse, Zuse's Z3, German mathematician created the first fully functional program controlled machine. War isolated project, therefore not widely known

Eniac, U.S. army, first program controlled machine, but no memory. Its declassified after the war and shared with the scientific community 

Patent never awarded:
- Suze never could get it (refused and delayed) 
- Spary Rand did it once, but a legal battle issued and they Antonosof could show that a computer concept is not ac tually patentable

Many invented the computer actually, that is still in evolution to our days.

### Who invented the first computer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcyGmlzw_U)

Computer was a job title given to humans mathematicians 

1837 Charles enraged of mistakes of humans, created the analytical machine, CPU:  mill, memory: store, programming lang: punch card

Candace Lovelace, first program, analytical could be used for things other than maths, like composing music

Faded into obscurity but computer revolution of the 1950 could've have happened a early
