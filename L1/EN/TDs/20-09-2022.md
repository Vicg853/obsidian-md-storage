## Biology text intro ex.
Scientists have been constantly searching ways on how to mitigate diseases and recently they found a new way to do it: by modifying the human genome. This new technology consists of modifying or developing human genome sequences, which can either modify the body's behaviour and shape, as well as designing a full human body. However, people think that this could pose a threat to humanity, by questioning its ethicality. Leading us to the following: can we accept the vision of a healthier future or should we be worried of it? 
With that though in mind, we will develop a first argument on how this new technology could be used for good and then, in a second stance, where could it bring us harm.
