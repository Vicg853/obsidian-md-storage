Some Graphs behave in particular ways.

#### Complementary graphs
These are Graphs that complement themselves as for Arc/Edge-wise. This can be easier understood as a Graph, which's complementary version, doesn't present its edges/arcs, but presents the edges/arcs missing in it.

Mathematically this can be noted: $G=(V, E)$ and $\bar G=(V, \bar E)$.

#### Regular graph
A regular graph behave in such a way that all his Nodes have the same degree.
