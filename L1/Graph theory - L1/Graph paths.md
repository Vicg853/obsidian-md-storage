There are also a set of definitions for observable patterns on a graph resembling the human definition of a path.

There are many different patterns, that will be listed here.

#### Chains
A chain is the most path resembling pattern: it defines a sequence of connected nodes, that usually colored to stand out from other nodes and edges.

##### Simple chain
A simple chain, is when in the defined sequence, no $(v_i, v_{i + 1}$ appears more than once in the chain sequence.

Note that, every simples chain, is at the same time necessarily an [[#Elementary chain|elementary chain]]. The same *does not* go the other way arround. 

##### Elementary chain
An elementary chain relates closely to [[#Simple chain| simple chains]], but this time, a same $v_i$ can't appear more than once in a chain sequence.
