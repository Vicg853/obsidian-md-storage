$$
\int_a^b uv' \mathsf dx = \left.uv\right\rvert_a^b - \int_a^b u'v\ \mathsf dx
$$

Note that, $v$ was considered to be before, in its derivative form, which means that when written outside the integral, we must write it in its primitive form.

E.G.: $$\begin{array}{l}
\int_a^b x \cos x\ \mathsf dx\ =\ \left.x \sin x\ \right\rvert_a^b - \int_a^b \sin x\ \mathsf dx\\ \\
v' = \cos x\\
v = \sin x\\
\end{array}$$
