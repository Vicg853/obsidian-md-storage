The Integral's general idea is of finding a curve's area, by doing the images differences of two integers $b$ and $a$, by a function's primitive ($f^-1$).

The integral is a simplification of [[Riemann|Riemann's method]], of fiddling a function's area, which consist of recursively doing additions on images of $f$.
