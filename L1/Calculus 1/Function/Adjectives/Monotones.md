There are three types of so called monotone functions:
- constants, where in a $f: D \mapsto R$ defined function, $f$ is completely invariant for any $x$ in $D$: $\forall x_1, x_2 \in D,\ \ f(x_1) = f(x_2)$
- growing, if for $f: D \mapsto R$, it increases for any given $x$ increasing in D: $\forall x_1, x_2 \in D,\ \ x_1 \le x_2,\ \ f(x_1) \le f(x_2)$ (the same applies to strictly growing functions)
- decreasing, if for $f: D \mapsto R$, it decreases for any given $x$ decreasing in D: $\forall x_1, x_2 \in D,\ \ x_1 \ge x_2,\ \ f(x_1) \ge f(x_2)$ (the same applies to strictly growing functions)

## Properties
- The addition or product of two growing functions, results into a growing function. Respectively and similarly this happens to decreasing functions, their product or addition also decreases;
- The addition of a fixed number (or a constant function) and a variable function, results in a function with same variation of the variable's function.
- The product of a fixed strictly positive number (or strictly positive and constant function) and a variable function, results  into a function with the same variation of the variable's function one;
- The product of a fixed strictly negative number (or strictly negative and constant function) and a variable function, results into a function with the opposite variation of the variable's function one
- As for the product of two variable functions, behaves similarly to the product of signed numbers: a ``growing * decreasing = decreasing``,  ``growing * growing = growing``, ``decreasing * decreasing = growing``
