There are some common general types, that are pretty common in the sequences world. They are so commonly used, that they were given names.

#### Geometric
We define a geometric sequence as having each next element defined by the product of a constant by the previous element:

$$U_{n + 1}=U_n \cdot r$$

We usually note the constant as $r$, for "reason", hence a sequence being called "geometric sequence of reason ..."

#### Arithmetic 
We define a arithmetic sequence as having each next element defined by the sum of a constant by the previous element:

$$U_{n + 1}=U_n + r$$

We usually note the constant as $r$, for "reason", hence a sequence being called "geometric sequence of reason ..."

#### Airthmo-geometric
We can compare it to a mix of a arithmetic and geometric sequence: its next element follows the form of the product of the current element by a constant, summed to another constant.

We can see that it is also looks like a linear function.

$$U_{n+1} = a\cdot U_n + b$$
