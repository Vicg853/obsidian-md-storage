The command line is split in two different pieces that are usually mismatched as being the same:
- the [[#Terminal|terminal]]
- and the [[#Shell|shell]]

They both are joined together, mostly so we can run [[Commands|commands]].

#### Terminal
The terminal is simply a visual interface, that receives and shows text. It does not process commands as it is believed to do, this is the [[#Shell|shell's]] role.

#### Shell
The shell is a program which's role is to process command and summon the respective called applications.
