One of the most powerful ways to interface with an OS is across terminal & shell. It allows the user or a program, to summon programs with versatility, to program/automate them and chain them. 

This couple allows then:
- _speed_: some actions can be done quicker by using a terminal interface with a shell behind
- _exhaustive_: usually GUIs, omit some information for simplicity (which isn't wrong, but just the best approach for such solution), while command lines, have the capacity of showing anything and welcoming of new solutions with new information
- _diffusible_ : sometimes, sharing written expressions, is easier than sharing step-by-step guides on using GUI

#### The difference
Whilst many confuse both as the same thing and the terminal and the shell usually work side-to-side, they aren't neither the same thing, nor dependent one of the other. They are totally independent: 

> [!abstract] TERMINAL
> The terminal is nothing more and nothing less than an interface, capable of receiving/displaying content. 

> [!abstract] SHELL
> The shell is the actual engine, that interprets and runs a provided content, providing then or not other content.

#### Syntax conventions
Although commands, terminal and shells are convenient, some basic conventions are still needed so we are able to exchange and communicate not only with humans but also the computer (they need something to look forward for, that they can understand).

One of the most accepted one is the [[The POSIX convention|POSIX convention]].
