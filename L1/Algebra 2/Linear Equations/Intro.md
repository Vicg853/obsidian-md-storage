Linear equations system, is defined by a set of $n$ variable equations. 

It following notation, is used to define and list this set:
$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
a_{11} x_{1}\ \ +\ a_{12} x_{2} +\ \dots\ \ + a_{n} x_{1n}\ =\ b_1 \\
a_{21} x_{1}\ \ +\ a_{22} x_{2} +\ \dots\ \ + a_{n} x_{2n}\ =\ b_2 \\
\ \ \ \ \vdots\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \vdots\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ddots\ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \vdots\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \vdots \\
a_{m1} x_{1} +\ a_{m2} x_{2} +\ \dots\ + a_{mn} x_{n}\  =\ b_m \\
\end{array}\right. $$

Where: 
- $m$ is a set's respective set's row index
- $n$ is a set's respective column index
- $a_{ij}$ are the equations' coefficients
- $x_j$ are the equations' unknowns
- $b_i$ are each respective equation's result

#### Matrix
Linear equations are also strongly tied to [[L1/Algebra 2/Matrix/Intro|matrices]] and can even be [[Linear equation rel.|represented as matrices]] (they usually separated into three matrices: a coefficients matrix, a unknowns matrix and a results matrix).

#### Pivot
A pivot, is the first non null element of a matrice's line. Each line's pivot, is usually always defined one one column after the last's line pivot column.
