#### Belonging properties
Let's consider $F$, a vector space and $K$ another vector space. $F$ is considered $K$'s sub-vector, if it meets the following expectations:
- first $K$'s null vector, must be a part of F: $0 \in F$;
- it respects $K$'s vector-to-vector operations. In other words, any sum of two of $K$'s vectors, must result in a vector that exists in $F$
- its respects $K$'s scalar-to-vector operations. In other words, any product between a scalar and one of $K$'s vector, must result in a vector that exists in $F$.

There is only a small clarification, about something that must be understood in the above statements: actually, commonly, the statements are made, by first assuming that $F \subset K$ and therefore we usually take the vectors from $F$ to test the expected properties, instead of the opposite. 
The way of thinking used above, was used without previously making this assumption, should come to the same conclusion in the end.
