Until now, matrices and equations systems, have only brought a written meaning for us. Nevertheless they are also relevant geometrically-wise and this usually also involves another big structure: Vectors and Vectorial spaces.

Vectors are a single column (and multi-line) or single line (and multi-column) matrices and are represented as an arrow, coming out of the space's center and going into the coordinates it defines.

Here are some key points around Vectors:
- [[#Vectors]] themselves;
- [[#Vector spaces]];
- [[Vector-VectorSpaces relations|Vectors against vector spaces]];

#### Vectors

#### Vector spaces
A vector space, is a geometrical (can be considered physical space) containing a Vector set. 
Differently than other mathematical subjects (like more pure geometry), when studying vector spaces, they originate from the null vector and direct themselves to a specified point.

This approach, makes algebraic manipulation, systems and linear applications easier.
