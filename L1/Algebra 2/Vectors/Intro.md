Until now, matrices and equations systems, have only brought a written meaning for us. Nevertheless they are also relevant geometrically-wise and this usually also involves another big structure: Vectors and Vectorial spaces.

Vectors are a single column (and multi-line) or single line (and multi-column) matrices and are represented as an arrow, coming out of the space's center and going into the coordinates it defines.

Here are some key points around Vectors:
- [[Vectors]] themselves;
- [[Vector spaces]];
- [[Vectors against vector spaces]];
