#### On 2 by 2 matrices
To find a matrice's inverse, there is a pretty simple method, that consists o finding this matrice's called determinant. When multiplying the matrix by its determinant, we successfully find its inverse. 

$$A = \left(\begin{matrix}a\ \ \ b\\ c\ \ \ d\end{matrix}\right)$$

Finding the determinant consists of
