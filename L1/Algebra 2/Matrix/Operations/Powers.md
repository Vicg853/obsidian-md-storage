As already demonstrated, multiplication matrice multiplication behaves differently than scalar multiplication and consequently, power too.

#### Power 0
By convention, a matrice, to the power of 0, is equal to the [[Identity matrix|identity matrix]].

#### Diagonal matrices
For diagonal matrices, we can pretty easily find its power: its simply the power of each diagonal element in their own same position.
