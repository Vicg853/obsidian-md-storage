Coding (as in encoding, decoding and not human-machine code (a.k.a programming) ), is one of the key computer science elements. 

It plays a fundamental role, from binary to human characters (small code [[List|list]]) as a way to compress data, calculate and store it: computers use only binary values, while we humans need visual and complex characters. Therefore, we need an entity which takes care of their translation.

This entity is called a transcoder and is usually given two different names, based on the main and translated language: 
- the encoder, which is supposed to transform the main language, into another 
- the decoder, which plays the role of translating the alternate language into a desired main one 
Both have anyway the same role: represent an information represented in a certain code, with another one.

In a computers core, decoding is done by transistors, which can be represented as Boolean functions and arithmetic.

Such as this encoder function, which transforms decimal digits 1 or 2 or 3, into their binary representation bits:
