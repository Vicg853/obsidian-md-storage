Computers think in a different language than ours, binary. Information needs to be translated than, so we can talk to them and vise-versa and that is the purpose of encoders as well as decoders. 

They play the role of finding any language's binary form (for encoders) and the other way around (for decoders).

#### Transcoders
Transcoders play a similar role, but they are more of a shortcut, allowing the translation between two different representation types, for example, translating a hexadecimal number into its base 10 format.
