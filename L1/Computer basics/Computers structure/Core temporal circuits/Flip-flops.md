A flip-flop consists of a core temporal circuit with the ability of retaining a certain value based on previous output and changing it based on new input. 

In other terms, the flip-flop has a state, which changes based on external input, while outputing it's current state.

It is based of a [Bitstable multivibrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivibrator#Bistable).

#### D
The D type flip-flop, is composed in such a way that values are only modifiable at a certain signal. 

It uses a J-K flip-flop at its core and has a single value input which is only recorded based on a given signal.
