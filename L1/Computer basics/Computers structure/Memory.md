If memory didn't exists, nothing we do would be possible: we depend on remembering past events. On a computer, this isn't different, remembering things, either on a short or long term, is essential. 

Hence storage devices and, on small scale, circuits.

But memory circuits, couldn't be crafted with usual combinational circuits, they require [[Temporal Circuits|non-combinational]] (or temporal) circuits.
