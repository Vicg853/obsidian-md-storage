Computers think in a different language than ours, binary. Information needs to be translated than, so we can talk to them and vise-versa and that is the purpose of encoders as well as decoders. 

They play the role of finding any language's binary form (for encoders) and the other way around (for decoders).

Both can actually be shrink-ed down and defined by a single word: they are both _transcoders_, they translate information from a representation format to another.

#### Encoder
Encoders are circuits, allow us to find a information's alternative representation in an encoded format.
Lets say for example: transforming human understandable information, into its binary format.

In computer modern science, we usually use the encoder term when transforming human understandable data, into a computerized format, be it binary, hexadecimal, etc...

##### In binary
The usual denary to binary encoder will have $2^n$ inputs (one for each integer) and $n$ outputs (for the integer binary representation).

#### Decoders
A decoder's role main role, is to a coded information into its main and non-coded form. As an example we can consider a decoder that transforms binary data into human readable data.

As form modern computer science circuits, it is usually used to describe a circuit which performs the translation of encoded binary or hexadecimal data into its human understandable format.

##### In binary
As for binary to denary encoders, differently than its opposed counter-party, it will have $n$ inputs (for binary values) and $2^n$ (for the denary representation).
