As [[L1/Computer basics/Computers structure/Intro|seen]] al sums up to circuits, that perform boolean arithmetic, which can become in wider and more complex systems, any sort of information. 

But at the base, these Boolean circuits, are pretty simple, to the point that, can be designed and developed using simple tools, like [[Karnaught tables]] and [[Basic boolean expressions]]. [[L1/Computer basics/Boolean logic/Simplification/Intro | Boolean function simplification]] also plays a big role on these systems, as they allow them be work faster and consume less energy, which is a very important thing on larger scales.
