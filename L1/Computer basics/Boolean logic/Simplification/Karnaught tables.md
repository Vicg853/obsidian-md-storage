Karnaught tables allow us to simplify most boolean arithmetic, mostly, boolean functions. They allow us to find different formats of a same function. These can vary and be either bigger or smaller.

Usually, the smallest format is the most optimal one, as it requires less space and calculations, which is critical on circuits and programming overall, as it means: less time spent on solving problems, less energy consumption and less required space. 

All of this, allows us to develop things such as CPUs, that have billions or even trillions (with numbers going up) of microscopic circuits (with numbers going down), which run at speed around 4GHz (with numbers going up), consuming 70 Watts (with numbers going down). This only one element, among many of its kind.

#### Basic


#### Advanced
Even though the basic version allows us to already perform many simplifications, we can find even simpler functions. For that we, make an analysis of the original function and fill the table with indifferent variables (cels, whose's value does not implicitly change the function's result).
