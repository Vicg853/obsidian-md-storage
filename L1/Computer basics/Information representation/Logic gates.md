Most of what is studied in [[Basic boolean expressions]], [[Complex boolean operators]] and [[Logic function simplification]] is used and applied in real life with logic gates. 
Obviously, in reality things we see in paper can differ a lot and be way more complex. Also, although Boolean logic is basically essential to logic gates, Boolean logic is not limited to them. 

Logic gates are physical applications of Boolean values. They receive one or more energetic input signal(s) and output one or more output signal(s), based on how they are supposed to behave. 

We can use Boolean logic to benchmark their behaviour and profile them. We can for example create truthiness tables to discover their values based of some cases, combine them to create complex results and use Boolean expression simplification techniques to reduce the number of used gates to a minimum, therefore consuming less resources, speeding calculation speed and reduce energy consumption.

For our purposes, we follow the "ANSI/IEEE 91-1984" convention for logic gates representation.



Logic gates are mostly related to Boolean operators, this PDF contains a list of some Boolean operators as logic gates/circuits: [[4-Circuits combinatoires.pdf | (hover me to see it)]].
