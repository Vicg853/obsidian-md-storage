Computers from a far away view nowadays, have numerous capacities, but at their cores, they work in a way simpler manner: they work with only two value, or more precisely, two states.

At the physical level, they are open circuit (current does not flow) and closed circuit (energy flows), while virtually they are represented by 0 (open circuit) and 1 (closed circuit). Virtually, this is a more of a convention than a life law, we have chosen both these values because they easier to represent and can be easily translated to false (0) and true (1).

We call each one of these values a _bit_ (binary digit).

With that out of the way, we can extend this concept, to represent other tah just ones and zeros. That actually is another of the reason for the 0, 1 choice: you can use it to represent anything else, more precisely, with only two values you can represent an infinity.

This is the _binary_ notation. We read binary from the right, to the left, and we use it almost as number decimal numeric representation (e.g.: 2003 -> 2 units, 0 tenths, 0 hundreds, and 3 thousands), the catch is that we actually use a base 2 representation...
...That is e use multiples of 2 (binary - 'bi' - two) to process the representation, e.g.: 1101 -> 1 unity, 0 dozen, 1 quatrain, 1 eight = 13

And these, are the basic foundations of how data is represented and calculated on a computer.
