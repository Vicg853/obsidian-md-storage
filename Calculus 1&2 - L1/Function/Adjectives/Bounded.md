Bounded functions are considered "limited" by either another function, or a constant. 
For example, if we have $\forall x \in \Bbb R, f(x) \le g(x)$ then we may state that $f$ is majored by $g$. 

Here function cases:
- $\forall x \in \Bbb R, f(x) \le g(x)$ then $f$ is majored by $g$;
- $\forall x \in \Bbb R, f(x) \ge g(x)$ then $f$ is minored by $g$;
- $\forall x \in \Bbb R, g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x)$ then $f$ is said bounded by both $g$  & $h$

The same applies to constant numbers: 
- $\forall x \in \Bbb R, f(x) \le M$ then $f$ is majored by $M$;
- $\forall x \in \Bbb R, f(x) \ge m$ then $f$ is minored by $m$;

## Bounded
When a function is bounded by both a maximum and minimum, we note the existence of real $C$, such as $C \ge 0$ and:  

$$\forall x \in D, \lvert f(x)\rvert \le C$$
