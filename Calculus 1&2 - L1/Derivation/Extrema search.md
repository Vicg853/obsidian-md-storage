As an introduction, consider the two following properties:
- a maximum is considered global, all images in this functions, are inferior or equal to this maximum $\forall x in I, t_0 \in I, f(x) \le f(t_0)$
- a maximum is considered local, when a for a that value, when for a set, all images are inferior or equal to this maximum, but in a different and open interval, that contains this local maximum, this value isn't considered the maximal one $\forall x in I, t_0 \in I \cap J, f(x) \le f(t_0)$

> [!NOTE]
> - A global maximum, is always a local maximum too
> - A function may not have an extrema, even it being minored or majored 

(the same can be applied and translated to minimum values)

#### Critical point
A critical point, is where a derived of the current function is equal to 0: $t_0 \in I, f'(t_0)  = 0$.
