A second order differential equation, follows the format: 
$$y''+ay'+by=c$$

They are often used on physics and other scientific subjects, where we have an image, based of multiple other forces.

#### Cauchy's problem
As differential equations, are strongly connected to Cauchy's problem. We may permit ourselves, to assume that:
$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}y''+ay'+by=c\\ y'(t) = k_1\\ y(t) = k_0\end{array}\right.$$

#### Solving
Similarly to [[Calculus 1&2 - L1/Differential equations/First order linear/Intro|first order]] linear differential equations, we usually start with a [[|homogenous form]].
