A linear differential equation, follows a similar format as linear equations, just a bit more well implemented:

$$\alpha(t)y' + \beta(t)y = \gamma(t)$$

We have therefore 3 functions (two of them are usually already "solved": they usually appear in a constant format already): $\alpha ,\beta$; And $\gamma$ which can usually be either a constant or function format. 
Finally our objective therefore is to find $y$, using the already "existing" elements, which will consequently allow us to find $y'$, its derivative (or vise versa).

#### Solving
One of the main ways of solving this equation format, is finding the derivative, by isolating it: we move $\beta y$ to the other side and dividing all by $\alpha$, leading us to $y' = -{\beta\over\alpha}y+{\gamma\over\alpha}$ or, for short:
$$y' = a(t)y+b(t)$$

We may now create many different technique branches, for different cases, in which we can use them: 
- [[Cauchy's problem]]
- [[Solving homogenous associated f|Solving associated functions]]
