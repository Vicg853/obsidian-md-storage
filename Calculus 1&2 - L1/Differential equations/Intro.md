We can sum differential equations to, a function (or a group of them), inside a function.
Consider the following differential equation: $y'' + 2y' + y = 0$, a second order differential equation, where each $y$, is actually a certain $x$'s image, by a function $f$ and the derivatives images $y''$ and $y'$, by the $f$'s derivatives $f''$ and $f'$ respectively.

Therefore, differential equations, is an equation, consisting of constants and a function, plus optionally its derivatives.

They can also be mixed with other function, which aren't necessarily related to $f$ (aren't one of it's derivatives), such as: $xy'+2y=0$; Here we have a function $a(x) = x$.

Therefore, studying differential equations, consists of finding, defining and solving all these equations.

These equations are tightly related to [[Cauchy's problem|Cauchy's problem]]: a system with multiple different functions, which can be joined and added, resulting in a single product. 

#### Differential equation types
Just like in simple functions, differential equations also have different "formats" and techniques we use to try to abstract and solve these problems, some of them are:
- [[Calculus 1&2 - L1/Differential equations/First order linear/Intro|Linear differential equations]]

#### Some divisibility concepts
Something that must be noted, as it can be useful in some differential equations, is algebra's [[Algebra - L1/Divisibility/Intro|divisibility notion]]:

Consider we have an second order differential homogenous equation such as $y''+y'+y=0$, $y$ is only one of his solutions, if $\lambda y$ is also a solution and also 

This relates to algebra in a similar way that for example $a\equiv b\ [n] \implies ac\equiv bc\ [n]$.

Consider the following proof example:
